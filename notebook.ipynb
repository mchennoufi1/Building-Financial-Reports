{"cells":[{"source":"## Help your hedge fund manager!\n\nYou have two datasets at your disposal: `Balance_Sheet.xlsx` and `Income_Statement.xlsx`. Both these datasets have three columns in common:\n- `\"Company\"`: The company's ticker name.\n- `\"comp_type\"` The type of industry the company in question belongs to. It is either `\"tech\"` for companies in the technology industry, `\"fmcg\"` for companies in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, and `\"real_est\"` for companies in the real estate industry. \n- `\"Year\"`: The year the company's information is from.\n\nThe rest of the columns in the datasets contain information from the financial statement of the `\"Company\"` in question. Note that the columns in `Balance_Sheet.xlsx` only contain financial information from the balance sheet. Similarly, the columns in `Income_Statement.xlsx` only contain financial information from the income statement. The columns are named accordingly. For instance, the column `\"Total Liab\"` from `Balance_Sheet.xlsx` is the total liability.","metadata":{},"id":"b6bb71db-d177-4226-a70e-f1340d7c5a3a","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"import numpy
